# Python for Security Analysts

A collection of Python scripts built to support real-world cybersecurity workflows — with a focus on DFIR, automation, triage, and investigation.

This repository is designed for analysts, investigators, and engineers who want tools they can adapt to their own environments. The code here addresses problems encountered in practical blue team work, from log review to file analysis to evidence enrichment.
