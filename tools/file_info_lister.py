Tool: Triage File Info Lister
Author: PatrickWorthey
Description:
    This script prompts the user to select a folder and then recursively scans it,
    listing file information including path, size, creation time, and modified time.

    Designed for digital forensics triage, evidence review, or file metadata snapshots.

Dependencies:
    Built-in: os, datetime, tkinter
